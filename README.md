This is a repository where I will be storing references, notes and other small programs that I will create in python during the course of my learning. This will be like a cloud space for me to store my programs and codes. Here you can find notes,other references and small practice programs that I will be making. If you are learning python too, you can find reference from here.

I am learning python from: www.codewithharry.com. You can also browse free programming language courses from here or visit his youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww

P.S.- This is a Hindi channel.
